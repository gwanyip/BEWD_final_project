# Proposal

For my final project i want to create a web app that helps people organize events such as birthdays.

It will allow a user to:

- Create a profile
- Select a date and location
- Allow peope to create profiles and sign up to the event
- Integrate with various APIs to help them with travel and accomodation for the event
- Allow people to leave comments and upload images
